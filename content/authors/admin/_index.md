I graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Florida with a B.A. in Political Science and a minor in Statistics. For three years, I worked as a member of the Florida Election Lab where I studied 
patterns in voter turnout and behavior across the United States. Most recently, I joined the New York DSCC
as a data analyst.

I have a passion for politics and an interest in the intersection between data and progressivism. I've seen every season of UK's Love Island and one day I hope to run a mile.
