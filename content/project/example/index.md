  For the purposes of my undergraduate thesis, I decided to take a look into voting behavior in my home state of Florida. In both 2008 and 2012, Barack Obama carried the state followed by two victories for Donald Trump. Everyone was, and is still, asking; What happened to Florida? In an attempt to gain insight into that answer, I decided to look at my own community of Jewish-Americans. I hypothesized that Donald Trump's rhetoric surrounding Israel would have an effect on Jewish voters in South Florida. To achieve this, I used the state voter file and precinct level data to compare voter turnout and vote choice in highly populated Jewish areas.
